## Alloys

As the description, name, and everything else has thrown in your face, this mod adds some alloys. The mod by itself isn't much good, so mod authors can add their own alloys, along with making recipes that require the alloys from this mod. That way they have much more use.

Here's a list of alloys:

- Amethyst Iron
- Obsidiamond
